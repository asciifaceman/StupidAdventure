# Stupid Adventure
A stupid adventure in C++ development to explore a language (beyond the context of arduino)
that I've managed to avoid for decades.

This project was intended for Visual Studio with vcpkg integratino because I'm too stupid
to manage c++ dependencies on my own and you probably know better than me how to get it
running in your local.
